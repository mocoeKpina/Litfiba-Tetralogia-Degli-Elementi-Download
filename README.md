## El diablo (1990)
     
El diablo is the first album of the Tetralogia degli elementi and it is dedicated to fire. It is the album that made Litfiba popular among the mainstream audience, thanks to the hit singles El diablo and Gioconda. The album is characterized by songs that denounce the alleged satanism of rock music (El diablo), the scarcity of water on the planet (Woda-Woda), and the prohibition of freedom in a controlled society (Proibito). There are also more intimate and introspective songs, such as Il volo, which remembers the tragic death of Ringo De Palma, a friend of the band who died of a heroin overdose, and Ragazzo. With this album, the band moved to a more direct and less underground rock style.

## Terremoto (1993)
     
Terremoto is the second album of the Tetralogia degli elementi and it is dedicated to earth. The main theme of this album is undoubtedly social and political criticism. Influenced by the Italian scenario (with the so-called Tangentopoli scandal that exposed the corruption of the First Republic), the album attacks the malpractice and the old system of power (Dimmi il nome, Dinosauro), criticizes the influence of mass media (Maudit), and portrays Florence, the hometown of the band, as a victim of an unstoppable decay (Firenze sogna). To these songs are added a sarcastic and allusive portrait of a couple in crisis (Il mistero di Giulia) and the two most remarkable songs of the album, the anti-war ballad Prima guardia (inspired by The Tartar Steppe by Dino Buzzati) and the poetic Fata Morgana, considered one of the best songs ever composed by the band and related to the optical phenomenon of the same name.

## Spirito (1994)
     
Spirito is the third album of the Tetralogia degli elementi and it is dedicated to air. It is one of the most successful albums of Litfiba, selling over 600,000 copies in Italy. The album features songs that explore different aspects of spirituality, such as Lo spettacolo, which deals with religion and faith, Spirito, which talks about transcendence and mysticism, La musica fa, which celebrates music as a form of expression and communication, Tammuria, which evokes ancient rituals and dances, Lacio drom (Buon viaggio), which means "good journey" in Romani language and refers to nomadism and freedom, No frontiere, which advocates for a world without borders and wars, Diavolo illuso, which warns about false idols and temptations, Telephone blues, which laments loneliness and isolation in modern society, Ora d'aria, which describes a moment of escape from reality, and Suona fratello, which invites to play music together.

## Mondi sommersi (1997)
     
Mondi sommersi is the fourth and final album of the Tetralogia degli elementi and it is dedicated to water. It is also the last album with Piero Pelù as lead singer before his departure from the band in 1999. The album explores the theme of the submerged worlds, both literally and metaphorically, as hidden and mysterious realities that can be fascinating or dangerous. Some of the songs are Ritmo, which is about the rhythm of life and music, Imparerò, which is about learning from mistakes and growing up, Regina di cuori, which is about a woman who seduces and manipulates men, Goccia a goccia, which is about the slow erosion of time and memory, Si può, which is about the possibility of change and improvement, L'esercito delle forchette, which is about consumerism and waste, Apri le tue porte, which is about opening up to new experiences and emotions, Dottor M., which is about a mad scientist who experiments on human beings, and In fondo alla boccia, which is about a fish trapped in a bowl.
